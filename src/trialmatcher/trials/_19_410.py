Post-mastectomy positive margins for invasive breast cancer and/or DCIS is not allowed. Multifocal disease (the presence of two or more foci of breast cancer within the same breast quadrant) and multicentric disease (the presence of two or more foci of breast cancer in different quadrants of the same breast) are allowed. 
    If answer is No to the above, patient must have positive margins per the following: Patients treated by BCS with focally positive margins for invasive breast cancer or DCIS (involving ≤ 3 high power fields) are eligible if additional surgery is not possible (e.g., posterior margin positive and deep resection margin abuts the chest wall or anterior margin positive and superficial resection margin abuts the skin). Boost radiotherapy must be administered for positive margins as described above.""",

    "Women of childbearing potential must have agreed to use an effective contraceptive method. A woman is considered to be of 'childbearing potential' if she has had menses at any time in the preceding 12 consecutive months. In addition to routine contraceptive methods, 'effective contraception' also includes heterosexual celibacy and surgery intended to prevent pregnancy (or with a side-effect of pregnancy prevention) defined as a hysterectomy, bilateral oophorectomy or bilateral tubal ligation, or vasectomy/vasectomized partner. However, if at any point a previously celibate patient chooses to become heterosexually active during the time period for use of contraceptive measures outlined in the protocol, she is responsible for beginning contraceptive measures. Women of childbearing potential will have a pregnancy test to determine eligibility as part of the Pre-Study Evaluation (see Section 4.0); this may include an ultrasound to rule-out pregnancy if a false-positive is suspected. For example, when beta-human chorionic gonadotropin is high and partner is vasectomized, it may be associated with tumour production of hCG, as seen with some cancers. Patient will be considered eligible if an ultrasound is negative for pregnancy.",
