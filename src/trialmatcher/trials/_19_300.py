Note: Women â‰¥ 70 years or older with T1 invasive ductal carcinoma who are estrogen-receptor positive (ER+) with clinically negative axillary nodes, and do not undergo surgical lymph node evaluation are eligible.

Note: In the event a patient is tested and is found to be a mutation carrier, she would be excluded from the study. It would be an extremely rare/unlikely scenario for patients to be discovered BRCA positive after the completion of PBI, as all patients with risk factors for BRCA mutations (positive family history, Ashkenazi Jewish descent, ER-/PR-/her2-neu negative receptor status) are usually tested prior to radiation.
